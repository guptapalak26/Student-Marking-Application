Hi there! Welcome to my Student Marking Application that I made for one of my courses using VBA in Excel. 

## Overview
This program interacts with the `registrar.mdb` database to manage student grades. When the program is run, it generates a GUI userform with the following options:

1. **Import Data:** Imports data into the sheet from the `registrar.mdb` database.
2. **List Courses:** Lists all the available courses in the database.
3. **Generate Report:** Generates a report in Word, which contains a histogram of the class marks for an assignment chosen by the user.
4. **Course Enrollment:** Displays the enrollment details of the students in a selected course.

Additionally, there's a button on the form to display the class average.

## Final Grade Calculation
The final grades are calculated based on the following weights:
- **Assignments (A1-A4):** 5% each
- **Midterm Exam:** 30%
- **Final Exam:** 50%

## How It Works
1. **Import Data:** Click the "Import Data" button to load student data from the `registrar.mdb` database.
2. **List Courses:** Click "List Courses" to display all available courses.
3. **Generate Report:** Choose an assignment to generate a Word report with a histogram displaying the class marks. The word report will be generated for you.
4. **Course Enrollment:** View the list of students enrolled in a specific course.
5. **Class Average:** Click the button to display the average grade for the class.


Thank you for reading :)
